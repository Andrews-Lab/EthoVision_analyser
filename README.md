# EthoVision XT 14 Analyser üêÅ

### Overview

__Noldus EthoVision XT 14 Analyser__

[Noldus EthoVision XT](https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt) is a video tracking software that allows the position of rodents in videos to be analysed over time. <br>
This can indicate the time spent in the dark zone of a light-dark box, the closed arms of an elevated plus maze, etc. <br>
It also allows the manual annotation of rodent behaviours over time (manual scoring).

__Purpose__

This code extends on the functions for analysing manually scored behaviours in EthoVision XT 14. It can: <br>
* Create visual barcodes of behaviours over time
* Re-create data about the time spent doing behaviours and number of behavioural bouts.
This will also make a group of behaviours mutually exclusive, if they are not already. <br>
This can be done by importing the raw tracking data from EthoVision XT. <br>
Currently, only version 14 of this software has been tested.

__About the labs:__ <br>
The [Lockie lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/lockie-lab) studies how hunger signalling in the brain drives mood-related behaviour, memory, motivation and metabolism in mouse models of disease. <br>
The [Andrews lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/andrews-lab) investigates how the brain senses and responds to hunger. <br>
The [Foldi lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/foldi-lab) investigates the biological underpinnings of anorexia nervosa and feeding disorders. <br>
