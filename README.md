# EthoVision XT 14 Analyser üêÅ

### Overview

__Noldus EthoVision XT 14 Analyser__

[Noldus EthoVision XT](https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt) is a video tracking software that allows the position of rodents in videos to be analysed over time. <br>
This can indicate the time spent in the dark zone of a light-dark box, the closed arms of an elevated plus maze, etc. <br>
It also allows the manual annotation of rodent behaviours over time (manual scoring).

__Purpose__

This code extends on the functions for analysing manually scored behaviours in EthoVision XT 14. It can: <br>
* Create visual barcodes of behaviours over time
* Re-create data about the time spent doing behaviours and number of behavioural bouts.
This will also make a group of behaviours mutually exclusive, if they are not already. <br>
This can be done by importing the raw tracking data from EthoVision XT. <br>
Currently, only version 14 of this software has been tested. <br>
